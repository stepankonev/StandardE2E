Supported Datasets
==================

Each row below lists the modalities the dataset processor currently emits
into the unified format. ``✓`` means the modality is wired end-to-end
through preprocessing and the on-disk ``TransformedFrameData`` schema;
``—`` means the dataset doesn't ship that modality (and it's surfaced as
the corresponding default value via
:class:`~standard_e2e.dataset_utils.modality_defaults.ModalityDefaults`).

All datasets also emit the ego **past/future trajectory** (from each
dataset's poses, via the segment-context aggregator) regardless of the
columns above.

.. note::

   **comma2k19 is high-volume** — 20 Hz × ~2000 one-minute segments ≈ 2.4 M
   frames (~2 TB at the native 1164×874 resolution). Two converter knobs bound
   the output size and processing time: ``--frame_stride N`` keeps **every
   N-th frame** (``1`` = full 20 Hz; e.g. ``--frame_stride 4`` ≈ 5 Hz), and
   the ``cameras_identity_adapter``'s ``max_size`` param **downscales** each
   frame so its longest side is at most that many px (intrinsics scaled to
   match).

.. [#wayve_lidar] WayveScenes101 ships **no sensor lidar**. Its ``lidar_pc``
   is populated from the per-scene **COLMAP SfM** point cloud: filtered
   (reprojection error ≤ 6, track length ≥ 2), converted OpenCV→FLU, then
   transformed into each frame's ego (FLU, x-forward/y-left/z-up) frame with
   the *world→ego* pose and range-clipped (50 m) so it flows through the
   standard lidar adapters. It is photogrammetric (sparse, up-to-scale), not
   a sensor measurement. The ego, cameras and lidar share one FLU frame, so
   a frame's cloud lifted by ``aux_data["pose_matrix"]`` reproduces the
   source SfM cloud exactly.

.. [#comma2k19] comma2k19 ships a **single forward-facing** 20 Hz camera
   (comma EON, 1164×874, treated as a pinhole; identity extrinsics, since the
   dataset pose *is* the camera pose) plus a fused GNSS/IMU ego pose and CAN
   telemetry — no lidar, HD map, 3D boxes, or driving command. The ego pose is
   derived from the ECEF ``global_pose`` into a per-segment local FLU frame
   (x-forward/y-left/z-up), so ``global_position`` X/Y/Z/heading are
   segment-relative; ``global_position`` additionally carries the ego
   **speed** (:attr:`~standard_e2e.enums.TrajectoryComponent.SPEED`) from the
   ECEF velocity. Segments must be extracted from the distributed
   ``Chunk_*.zip`` archives first (as with WayveScenes101); each ``video.hevc``
   is then decoded forward-only, since HEVC random seek is unreliable. Native
   rate is 20 Hz — use ``--frame_stride`` to subsample.

.. [#truckdrive] TruckDrive (Torc Robotics / Princeton, CVPR 2026) is a
   long-range highway **heavy-truck** dataset. Its 8 MP surround rig has
   **11 cameras** — more than the eight canonical
   :class:`~standard_e2e.enums.CameraDirection` slots — so each camera is
   mapped to the canonical member matching its facing wherever one fits, with
   dedicated members added only for the extra views the eight can't name: the
   forward telephoto pair (``FRONT_LEFT_NARROW`` / ``FRONT_RIGHT_NARROW``) and
   the rear-facing side pair (``SIDE_LEFT_BACK`` / ``SIDE_RIGHT_BACK``).
   ``lidar_pc`` is the seven-sensor **Aeva FMCW** joint cloud (xyz kept,
   transformed into the ego ``velodyne`` frame); ``detections_3d`` are the
   tracked 3D boxes in the ego frame, with the ego vehicle's own cab/trailer
   and ``DontCare`` groups excluded per the paper taxonomy. The ego pose
   (PPK + LiDAR-SLAM) drives the past/future trajectory. Short-range Ouster
   lidar, 4D radar, accumulated GT depth and lane lines have no StandardE2E
   target yet and are not ingested. The dataset ships as per-scene,
   per-modality zips and **must be extracted first**
   (``scripts/extract_truckdrive.sh``, or
   ``scripts/prepare_dataset_truckdrive.sh`` to extract and preprocess in one
   step); frames are matched across sensors by their synchronization key.

How datasets are added
----------------------

See `Adding New Datasets Guide
<https://github.com/stepankonev/StandardE2E/blob/main/standard_e2e/caching/src_datasets/adding_new_dataset.md>`_
for the full processor → adapter → aggregator pipeline a new dataset has
to plug into.
